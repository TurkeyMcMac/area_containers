This is a mod for [Minetest][1]. It implements an "area container," that is,
a node that holds an area in which you can walk around and build stuff. The
structures in the container can communicate with the outside using
[Mesecons][2] and/or [Digilines][3]. Items can pass in and out through tubes
from the [Pipeworks][4] mod.

## Caveats

- While a container is not diggable until you empty it of nodes and objects,
  other mods may let you pick it up in order to move it. Doing so will probably
  lead to loss of the contents. (But you _can_ push containers with pistons.)
- You cannot yet pass a mesecons signal from one port to another with no delay
  inbetween due to [this bug in Mesecons][5]. Other related issues may exist.
- Only up to 65535 containers may exist at any one time.
