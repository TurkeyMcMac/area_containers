This is a mod for [Minetest][1]. It implements an "area container," that is,
a node that holds an area in which you can walk around and build stuff. The
structures in the container can communicate with the outside using
[Mesecons][2] and/or [Digilines][3]. Items can pass in and out through tubes
from the [Pipeworks][4] mod.
