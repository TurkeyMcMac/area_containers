[![ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/packages/jwmhjwmh/area_containers/shields/title/)](https://content.minetest.net/packages/jwmhjwmh/area_containers/)

This is a mod for [Minetest][1]. It implements an "area container," that is,
a node that holds an area in which you can walk around and build stuff. The
structures in the container can communicate with the outside using
[Mesecons][2] and/or [Digilines][3]. Items can pass in and out through tubes
from the [Pipeworks][4] mod.

## Locking

Area containers can be locked. To do so, first craft a lock. Then punch a
container with the lock (you must be either the one who built the container or
one able to bypass protection.)

If a container is unowned and you can bypass protection, you can claim it by
locking it.

To let other people in, first craft a blank key. Then punch your container with
the key, binding the key to the container. Other people can enter the container
while holding the key. The container contents themselves are not protected in
any way.

You can unlock your container by punching it with your bare hand. You must
remove the lock before breaking the container. All keys to the container will
continue to work even if you uninstall and reinstall the lock.

## Caveats

- Due to an unfortunate technical limitation, area containers cannot be moved
  by pistons.
- This mod does not load the insides of containers without players in them.
  If you need this feature, you can use the world anchor node from Technic.
- While a container is not diggable until you empty it of nodes and objects,
  other mods may let you pick it up in order to move it. Doing so will probably
  lead to loss of the contents.
- Only up to 65535 containers may exist at any one time.
